                <h4>What is Pylint?</h4>
                <p> Pylint is a Python static code analysis tool which looks for programming errors, helps enforcing a coding standard, sniffs for code smells and offers simple refactoring suggestions. It’s highly configurable, having special pragmas to control its errors and warnings from within your code, as well as from an extensive configuration file. It is also possible to write your own plugins for adding your own checks or for extending pylint in one way or another.<br style="clear: both;" /></p>
                <p><b>Pylint can be installed by running</b>:   pip install pylint</p>
                <br><h4>Features Of Pylint</h4>
                <br><p><b>Coding Standard:</b> Pylint is a preferred tool due to the special abilities it provides such as checking the length of the line code. It also provides the ability to check according to the user’s coding standards, if the variable names are well formed. Finally, Pylint can check if the user is using imported modules.</p>
                <p><b>Error Detection:</b> Pylint’s other great feature is the internal mechanism for error detection. To be more specific, it can check if the declared interfaces are implemented with true syntax and if there are any imported modules.</p>
                <p><b>Refactoring:</b> As other tools, Pylint has also the ability to detect duplicated code. This process includes code refactoring, by restructuring existing code, without modifying the external behavior. Refactoring improves the design, the main structure and the implementation of the software.</p>
                <p><b>Fully Customizable:</b> with Pylint , the user has the option to modify “pylintrc “, in order to customize which errors and conventions are important according his personal priorities and preferences. Pylint has also the great advantage of being configurable, customizable with the ability to write custom plugins for personal implementations.</p>
                <p><b>Editor Integration:</b> It can be used with many code editors in the market. Most of the supported editions are emacs , vim (pylint.vlm, syntastic), eclipse, etc.</p>
                <p><b>IDE Integration:</b> Another great advantage of this software tool is the ability to support various IDE’s. The main list of support is: Spyder, Editra, TextMate, Eclipse with PyDev, etc.</p>
                <p><b>UML Diagrams:</b> Another great feature of Pylint is the extra content called Pyreverse which creates UML diagrams for python code. It is usually shipped with Pylint.</p>
                <p><b>Continuous Integration:</b> Pylint allows the user to run it in his project code. This process can be automated using  Apycot, Hudson or Jenkins.</p>
                <p><b>Extensibility:</b> In scenarios where many users are facing the problem, where the underlying Astroid library doesn’t understand the code, this can be solved by contributing a patch to pylint-brain.</p>
